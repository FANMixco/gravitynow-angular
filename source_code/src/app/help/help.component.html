            <h3>What is Gravity?</h3>
            <p>Gravity, is a natural phenomenon by which all physical bodies attract each other. It is most commonly recognized and experienced as the agent that gives weight to physical objects, and causes physical objects to fall toward the ground when dropped from a height. [¹]</p>
            <p>Its standard value on the Earth is 9.80665 m/s² (32.1740 ft/s²) is the one originally adopted by the International Committee on Weights and Measures in 1901 for 45° latitude, even though it has been shown to be too high by about five parts in ten thousand.</p>

            <h4>What else does gravity do?</h4>
            <p>Why do you land on the ground when you jump up instead of floating off into space? Why do things fall down when you throw them or drop them? The answer is gravity: an invisible force that pulls objects toward each other. Earth's gravity is what keeps you on the ground and what makes things fall. [²]</p>

                <h3>Gravity change</h3>
                <p>Anything that has mass also has gravity. Objects with more mass have more gravity. Gravity also gets weaker with distance. So, the closer objects are to each other, the stronger their gravitational pull is.</p>
                <p>Earth's gravity comes from all its mass. All its mass makes a combined gravitational pull on all the mass in your body. That's what gives you weight. And if you were on a planet with less mass than Earth, you would weigh less than you do here. [¹]</p>

                <p>You exert the same gravitational force on Earth that it does on you. But because Earth is so much more massive than you, your force doesn't really have an effect our planet.</p>
                <p>Also, the gravity varies all over our planet, it's not homogeneous.</p>

                <h3>Formula</h3>
                <p>The formulas used by this App are based on the International Gravity Formula 1967 (IGF)¹ which determines the gravity from the position of latitude, and the Free Air Correction (FAC)² which corrects for height above sea level.</p>
                <p class="centered"><span class="fontItalic">ICF</span> = 9.780327 (1 + 0.0053024<span class="fontItalic">sin</span>²Φ - 0.0000058<span class="fontItalic">sin</span>²2Φ)</p>
                <p class="centered"><span class="fontItalic">FAC</span> = -3.086 ✕ 10<sup>-6</sup> ✕ <span class="fontItalic">h</span></p>
                <p class="centered fontItalic">g = IGF + FAC</p>
                <p><b>Symbols</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>g</b> = Theoretical local gravity</li>
                    <li><b>IGF</b> = International Gravity Formula</li>
                    <li><b>FAC</b> = Free Air Correction</li>
                    <li><b>Φ</b> = Latitude</li>
                    <li><b>h</b> = Height relative to sea level</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Key concepts</b></p>
                <p><b>Latitude</b></p>
                <p>Position relative to the equator in decimal degrees. Latitude can only be specified between -90° and 90°.</p>
                <p>You can determine the latitude position by going to Google Maps and right clicking on the required location and then selecting “Drop LatLng Marker” which will display the decimal latitude value first before the longitude value.</p>
                <p><b>Height/Altitude</b></p>
                <p>Height above sea level is a value in metres or feet. If you do not know the height above sea level you should be able to obtain it from your national geological survey maps.</p>
